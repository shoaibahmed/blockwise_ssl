# Blockwise SSL

A PyTorch implementation for the paper [***Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning at Scale***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01647).

## Execution

To train the model, use `train.sh` script.
The default hyperparameters refers to our best setting, including noise injection.

For testing based on the linear evaluation protocol, use `eval.sh`.
The script trains 4 different linear evaluation heads, one for each of the different blocks of the model.
