# Blockwise SSL

A PyTorch implementation for the paper [***Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning at Scale***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01647).

## Execution

To train the model, use `train.sh` script.
The default hyperparameters refers to our best setting, including noise injection.

For testing based on the linear evaluation protocol, use `eval.sh`.
The script trains 4 different linear evaluation heads, one for each of the different blocks of the model.

## Pretrained Checkpoint

Our main model (***Simultaneous Blockwise Training (1x1 CbE + GSP)***, without noise addition) is available to be downloaded from [***Google Drive***](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HFgSjJT0LW5H2E5m4v0ThCzGSXa25zxt).

The model achieves a final accuracy of ***70.15%*** (from the output of block-4).
